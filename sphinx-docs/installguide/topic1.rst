Introduction
====
KA Lite is software that allows users without Internet access to 
engage with Khan Academy videos and exercises in completely offline 
settings, bringing the flipped classroom model to some of the most 
remote areas in the world. Users can track their progress through 
videos and exercises, and coaches can log in and check up on their 
progress to identify which areas the students need the most help in. 
If KA Lite ever reaches an Internet connection, it can sync this usage 
data with the KA Lite Hub, an online data repository that allows project
administrators to view data and manage accounts remotely of offline deployments.
