   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

KA Lite Documentation
===================================

KA Lite is lightweight web app that allows users without Internet access to engage with `Khan Academy`_ videos and exercises in completely offline settings, bringing the flipped classroom model to some of the most remote areas in the world. Users can track their progress through videos and exercises, and coaches can log in and check up on their progress to identify which areas the students need the most help in.


Side note we should probably have some fat notice on how to download the videos, or at least mention in the guide that * THE VIDEOS WILL NOT COME WITH THE SOFTWARE INITIALLY * ... because users are probably expecting the videos to be there after the set up... but there are none... just saying


I just want to give an example here of how documentation can be organized. Be sure to check out the source and the `rst primer`_ and `toctree directive`_!
