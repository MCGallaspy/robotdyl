Important Terms for Project Administrators to Know
-------------------------------------------

**Sharing Network**
	A sharing network is a group of devices that share data between one another.

**Organization**
	An organization is a group of people responsible for administering a set of Sharing Networks. An organization can have multiple administrators and manage multiple sharing networks.

**Facility**
	A facility is the physical space in which a device is located (e.g. a school or a computer lab in a community center). Student, coach, and admin accounts are associated with a particular facility.

**Device**
	A device should be able to run a KA Lite server (most computers) and other devices to be used as clients. One common configuration is using a Raspberry Pi or other inexpensive computer as a server and relatively cheap tablets as client devices. Tablets can access the servers through an access point, such as a Wi-Fi dongle, or some other networking device such as a router.

Setting up KA Lite
-------------------
Once you have successfully installed KA Lite, the installation script should give you a URL (http://127.0.0.1:8008/) to visit so that you can login for the first time. 

Copy and paste the URL into a web browser and login to KA Lite using the username and password you created during the installaiton process. If you have forgotten the username/passwrod combination, simply delete this version of KA Lite. If it is critical that you are able to login with your credentials, :doc:`../contact` and we can help you manually reset your login information.
