Administrator Glossary
-------------------------------------------

**Sharing Network**
	A sharing network is a group of devices that share data between one another.

**Organization**
	An organization is a group of people responsible for administering a set of Sharing Networks. An organization can have multiple administrators and manage multiple sharing networks.

**Facility**
	A facility is the physical space in which a device is located (e.g. a school or a computer lab in a community center). Student, coach, and admin accounts are associated with a particular facility.

**Device**
	A device should be able to run a KA Lite server (most computers) and other devices to be used as clients. One common configuration is using a Raspberry Pi or other inexpensive computer as a server and relatively cheap tablets as client devices. Tablets can access the servers through an access point, such as a Wi-Fi dongle, or some other networking device such as a router.

Setting up KA Lite
-------------------
Once you have successfully installed KA Lite, the installation script should give you a URL (http://127.0.0.1:8008/) to visit so that you can login for the first time. 

Copy and paste the URL into a web browser and login to KA Lite using the username and password you created during the installaiton process. If you have forgotten the username/password combination, simply delete this version of KA Lite (delete the “ka-lite” folder that you downloaded during the installation guide steps for your system and then redo the installation steps in the Install Guide). If it is critical that you are able to login with your credentials, :doc:`../contact` and we can help you manually reset your login information.

Once you’ve logged in, the next step in the setup process is registering your device with the KA Lite Hub.

Registering Your Device with the Hub
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By registering your device with FLE, you can sync data back with our central data hub. This is useful for many reasons:

    #. a project administrator can manage user accounts and view usage data from afar, without needing to physically visit the offline device.
    #. usage data syncing back can inform the FLE team of multiple users in a certain geographic region, and we can connect people that might be able to help one another
    #. it helps FLE and our partners understand where and how the software is being used, so we can keep adding features that support you!
